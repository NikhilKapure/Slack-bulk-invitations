# Slack-bulk-invitations
invite all users (the entire team) to a new Slack channel. 

/*
  Instructions: Just browse to the appropriate channel and paste 
  this script (below) into your Chrome/Firefox dev console and hit enter. 
  Then wait for the script to run until it completes. 
  It might take time as there is a limit to how many users may be invited at once. 
  The script will loop until all team members are invited.
